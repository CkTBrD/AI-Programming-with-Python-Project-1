Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No, not all architecture classified Dog_01.jpg to the be the same breed. Vgg and Resnet classified the breed as Shih-tzu Alexnet did not. Alexnet classified this breed as a tibetan terrier/chrysanthemum dog. Technically chrysanthemum dog is correct however a tibetan terrior is differnt but was somehow considered the same with this architecture. Therefore 2 out 3 model architectures classified Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed (Vgg and Resnet).


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, both Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg were classified correctly as the correct breed in this case a Shih-tzu or tibetan terrier with all 3 model architectures.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes, all 3 models correctly classified Animal_Name_01.jpg (Monkey_01.jpg) and Object_Name_01.jpg (Porsche_01.jpg) to not be dogs. 


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: Initally, I suspected Vgg and Resnet to tie and be the top performers. Though they did tie in providing the correct Shih-tzu dog  breed, the code created was not able to correctly spit out the correct statistical results for the images. Alexnet did the best at classifying the uploaded images when compared to the Vgg and Resnet. In addition the correct statistical results was provided. A snippet of the results is shown below. What I suspect is Alexnet is more advanced being that the classifier has more than one dog breed within it's library classify images against or in other words "more trained" than the other architectures.
